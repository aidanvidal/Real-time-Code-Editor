A real time code editor for Javascript made using React, Node.js, and some JS libraries.
This project consists of two parts:

# Technologies Used
- React was used for the Frontend
- Node.js was used for the Backend
- Used ShareDB for the OT (Operational Transformation) to maintain consistency in the collaboritive editing.
- MongoDB is used to store the document history.
- AceEditor is used as the main coding editor.
- Websockets used to communicate the data to the server along with some HTTP
